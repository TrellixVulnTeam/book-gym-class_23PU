CLI tool for booking tomorrows gym class in Flyefit

With the introduction of booking systems in gyms around the country it has become increasingly difficult to book classes due to them booking out in under a minute after it they open. 
This tool will initially allow me to book without having to open a browser and constantly refresh, minimising time lost. 
A further improvement I hope to add is to allow me to run the script well in advance of the slot opening. 
The script will then wait for the slot to become open for bookings (24 hrs before the class) and make the booking straight away.
